    <h1>Spam Email Classifier – Neural Network in Java</h1>

        Built a spam email classifier from scratch in Java as part of my Machine Learning course. 
        The project involved implementing a feedforward neural network to distinguish spam from non-spam messages, with a focus on understanding the core mechanics of neural networks.

      <p>
        I contributed to parsing the dataset into features and targets, coding key components of the <code>backpropagation</code> function, and implementing a hyperparameter tuning class 
        to optimize learning rate and hidden layer size. The network was built using an object-oriented approach, with <code>Node</code> classes representing individual neurons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our final model achieved <strong>74% precision</strong>, <strong>60% recall</strong>, and a <strong>67% F1 score</strong> on the test set, demonstrating solid performance 
        for a custom-built model without external libraries.
