        I developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate cardiac action potentials,
        with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of electrical signaling in the heart.
        A graduate student collaborator concurrently developed a continuous model, and together
        we performed robustness analysis by generating error-time graphs. This involved varying
        parameters such as the time step size to identify the optimal values that minimize modeling error.

        This research was presented at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) in Seattle.
